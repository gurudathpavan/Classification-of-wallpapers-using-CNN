# Classification-of-wallpapers-using-CNN

# Project 3 Description-2018
Training a Convolutional Neural Network
Due: March 2nd
You will be training a CNN on the wallpaper images we previously classified in the last project.  You will be using the Matlab inbuilt CNN training functions (because of their ease).  You will learn how to augment the data, build a CNN, and train on the data.  Do not wait until the deadline for this project since some steps can take a while to run.  Start this project early.

Data: Wallpaper Pattern Images
The dataset consists of 17,000 images, 1,000 images per group, and each image containing a wallpaper pattern.  The images are 256x256 and 1 channel (grayscale).  You will be training networks to discover these patterns.  The datasets are located in the "data/wallpapers/<train,test>/<group>/" folders.  The train and test images are in separate folders and within them, there are folders for each wallpaper group's images.
